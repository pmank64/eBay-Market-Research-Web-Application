# eBay Market Research Application

Web Application for performing research on competitor prices.

### Description

This web application has been created to take the guess work out of pricing products on eBay. Using the eBay APIs, this Flask application can search for recently completed products on eBay given any keyword search. Recently completed products include those that have either sold, or listings that have ended without any sales. These results are displayed in a grid under the search bar, and the user is able to view the price and an image of each of the products. In addition, each item is color coded to indicate if it sold or not (either red or green). The user can understand the best price for their item based on what is selling or not, and at what price.

### Other Features

In addition to this functionality, the software allows a user to make an account, edit aspects of their account, and create a list of saved items that are automatically stored in a database.

### Target User

The intended user of this software is a person who is selling products on eBay. This software solution is particularly beneficial for a business on eBay with a high volume of sales. The web application makes it easier and faster to research a large number of items in a short period of time.

### Project Origin

The idea for this software came about from one of our team members who has sold products on eBay in the past. While eBay has advanced search functionality to view completed listings and understand how products are selling, it is not an efficient method if you have a large number of listings. In addition, there is no easy way to save listings that you have found while searching.
